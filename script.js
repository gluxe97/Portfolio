All terms that can be used to categorize me and place me into a box. Although none 
truly capture the  experiences I've been through, my personality, or my individuality.
 I am an ambitious 24 year old with too many hobbies and not enough time in the day. 
 My main hobbies include Working Out, 3D Modeling, Woodworking, Photography, Fashion,
and creation in general. I find creating things from nothing but a thought very intriging 
and to be one of the greatest feelings of achievement you can experience. My curiousity 
has given me an abudance of knowledge in many fields which allows me to find common interests
with most people I meet. I am well rounded and pick up new skills very fast. 
I love sports! My favorite teams include the Dallas Cowboys, Mavericks, and Chicago Bulls.
